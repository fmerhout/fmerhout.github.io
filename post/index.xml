      <description>From June 17 to June 28, 2019, I had the pleasure of co-organizing the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science 2019 partner site in Los Angeles. Besides meeting 41 bright, inspiring young computational social science scholars from Southern California and beyond, I have been fortunate to work with my amazing co-organizers Alina Arseniev-Koehler, Bernard Koch, Marcel Roman, Pablo Geraldo, Mike Tzen, and Jennie E. Brand. The partner site was hosted by the California Center for Population Research (CCPR) at the University of California and used facilities at the Luskin School for Public Affairs.</description>

      <description>I am excited to announce that I will be co-organizing a partner site for the 2019 Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) together with Alina Arseniev-Koehler and Jennie E. Brand in beautiful Southern California. SICSS-Los Angeles will run from Monday, June 17 to Friday, June 28, 2019 at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Thanks to generous funding from the California Center for Population Research (CCPR) there is no cost to participate, and we will provide refreshments for all on-site days.</description>

      <description>I am excited to be given the opportunity to co-host a tutorial on the textnets package for R at the 2018 European Symposium Series on Societal Challenges with my amazing colleagues Taylor Brown and Marcus Mann. The symposium will take place in Cologne, Germany from December 5 to 7 with our workshop and many more scheduled for the first day of the event.
NB: This post describes the tentative schedule and will be updated as we finalize the details for the tutorial.</description>
